# Simple Weather App

Here we have a simple weather app that uses an external API from DarkSky.
This app uses vanilla Javascript for the logic and html/css for structure and styling.

I used skycons for the animated icon which will change to the current weather conditions.

The weather app will show the weather at your current location or as close too you as possiable.

The temperature gauge can be change by clicking on it, from farenheit to celsius.
